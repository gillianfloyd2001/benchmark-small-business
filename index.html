                announce that we now will deliver, but we will only be delivering close to the store.</p>
            <p id="second_paragraph">The whole idea behind the Cupcakes 4 Daze was to make cupcakes available for
                everyone and to have some whenever you want. I am just trying to please everyone in my community.</p>
            <p id="third_paragraph">We also have on our website where you can request a large amount of cupcakes from as
                big as a family reunion or a small party. </p>
